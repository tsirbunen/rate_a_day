# RATE A DAY

## What's it all about?

Sometimes after a miserable day or two at work it feels that it's _always_ miserable.
Remembering the good days might be difficult.
**RATE A DAY** helps with this. After each working day, evaluate your day on two 2-point scales:

1. Were you mostly happy or unhappy today?
2. Did you learn anything new today?

If you keep recording your daily evaluations, then, next time you feel miserable, you can view your earlier evaluation history and see how frequent the miserable days actually are.
